I'd like a cake.

Ideally, I'd like to bake it myself, but if I don't 
have the ingredients, I'll buy one from the bakery 
(if they have one).

I can make 2 types of cake. 
My favourite is a mud cake (egg, chocolate, flour).
I can also make a flourless cake (egg, chocolate, cocoa).

There might be some chocolate in the fridge or the pantry.
There might be some flour in the pantry.
There might be some cocoa in the pantry.

There might be an egg in the fridge, but I'd prefer a fresh
one - maybe my chook laid one?

But I think I saw a taipan around the chicken coup yesterday
- hopefully he didn't get my chook!

So, do I get a cake and, if so, which one?
